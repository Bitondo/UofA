# Sample Usecases



###Challenge1 — Cryptocurrency Exchange:

Cryptocurrencies like BitCoin/Ethereum have become a very popular payment method that can increasingly be used interchangeably with traditional currency. As the CTO of startup, you realize the business opportunity in cryptocurrencies and you decide to create a cryptocurrency exchange.



The task is to come up with an exchange that give clients the user-experience they’ve come to expect from traditional banking systems. Security is critical here as cryptocurrency digital wallets can be stolen, chain-code can be modified to an exploiter benefit and market values can be manipulated.

 

Examples:

- Real time tracker of currency

- Buy/Sell orders

- Cellphone app

- Fraud detection

- Apple/Google Pay on phone but for your cryptocurrency

  ​

###Challenge 2 — “Augmented Reality” shopping:

Over the past decade, online shopping portals have eroded into brick and mortar store profits. Your firm has been contracted to create an innovative solution to enhance and provide a unique experience for shoppers walking through aisles that cannot be found online.



 Examples:

- Cell phone app
- Camera overlay
- Proximity alerts (discount on items, re-stocking etc)
- In-store games (like Pokemon Go but for groceries) to get discounts/win prizes etc.

 

### Bonus for Challenge 1 & 2

Integrate cryptocurrency from challenge 1 as payment method for challenge 2 with some incentives.



### Challenge 3 

Implement any board game as a blockchain app.



Examples:

- Monopoly
- Clue
- Risk



### Challenge 4 — **The Sustainable Supply Chain Problem:**

Identifiy a problem and create a blockchain solution that includes any number of the following: 

- Product integrity 
- Transparency of data so all parties can see the chain of trade for goods
- Reduction of human errors, faster response time to delivery challenges
- Authentication of goods and services that make up a sustainable product 
- Detection of unethical suppliers and counterfeiters



###Challenge 5 — **The Digital Identity Problem:**

Digital identity is a growing concern for all of us. Identify a particular situation where your digital identity could be at risk or could be improved through the use of blockchain. Ideas could include any of the following:

- Access to birth records, passports and license information
- Ability to cost-effectively and seamlessly share data across borders and jurisdictions
- Secure access to payments, credit, government records, health records, or academic qualifications
- Enabling Self-sovereignty by allowing individuals to control who can access their identity data via blockchain permissions

**Examples of what makes a good use case by characteristics of blockchain:**

1. Distributed ledger — There is a need to share data across multiple companies. A "company" could be any group divided by political, geographical or organization boundary that has it operating as its own entity.
2. Distributed — There is no central point of control or ownership. This also means there is no shared server. The idea is that writing to someone's database on a shared server is not acceptable or is inefficient.
3. Indelible ledger — There is a need for a permanent, indelible record of transactions.
4. Smart Contracts — Business rules and data used in transactions can be visible to multiple members.

*Note:* If data is only used by one organization than it is probably not a good use of blockchain.
